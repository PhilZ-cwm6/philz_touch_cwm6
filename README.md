#### Building

If you haven't build recovery ever before, please look up the thread linked above.
If you regularly build ROMs/Recoveries for your device, and have a working CWM setup
on your build machine, then you can quickly set up and build Philz Touch recovery as well

Check these three patches are present in your build/ directory
    1. https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_build/commit/fddc5f4

Clone philz recovery to bootable/recovery-philz folder

    git clone https://github.com/PhilZ-cwm6/philz_touch_cwm6 bootable/recovery-philz -b cm-11.0

Now build with RECOVERY_VARIANT flag set to philz:

    . build/envsetup.sh && lunch && mka -j3 recoveryimage RECOVERY_VARIANT=philz

or

    export RECOVERY_VARIANT=philz
    . build/envsetup.sh && lunch && mka -j3 recoveryimage

or

    add to device BoardConfig.mk:
        RECOVERY_VARIANT := philz
    and run:
        build/envsetup.sh && lunch && mka -j3 recoveryimage
